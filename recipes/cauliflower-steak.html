    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One of my favourite ways to cook cauliflower is to cut it into steaks, then serve with chimichurri + a creamy butter bean purÃ©e. It sounds fancy, but itâ€™s actually super easy to make, comes together in no time at all & uses only simple, plant-based ingredients ðŸŒ±</p>

            <li>2 tbsp red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>100 mlOlive Oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For Butter Bean PurÃ©e</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>700g jarred butter beans (aka lima beans)</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove</li>
            <li>2 tbsp nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>Salt & pepper</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>First, make the chimichurri. Finely chop the fresh herbs, then add to a mixing bowl. Finely dice the chilli, mince the garlic + add to the herbs with the vinegar. Season to taste, then stream in the olive oil whilst mixing until throughly combined. Set aside.</li>
                <li>For the butter beans, simply pour into a blender with the juice of a lemon, salt, pepper, 1 garlic clove + nutritional yeast</li>
                <li>For the cauliflower, chop into steaks- you should be able to get two from the middle of a large one. Save the extra florets for another recipe, or roast with salt, pepper, paprika + olive oil to serve alongside the steaks</li>
                <li>Chop up the leaves + stems & set aside for a zero-waste garnish</li>
                <li>Season the steaks with salt, pepper + paprika on both sides, then drizzle with oil + massage well.</li>
                <li>Heat a frying pan to medium high. Add 2 tbsp olive oil. Once hot, add the steak - press down to sear. After several minutes, flip + fry other side until golden brown</li>
                <li>Bash the garlic cloves, add with the butter + baste continuously. Once the steaks are cooked, remove from the pan + add the chopped leaves/stems with a splash more oil & cook until golden + crisp</li>
                <li>To serve, pour the bean purÃ©e into the middle of a plate. Place the steak on top, drizzle with chimichurri & scatter over the cauli leaves</li>
            </ol>
