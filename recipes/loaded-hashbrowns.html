            <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pre heat oven to 350F. Place hashbrowns on a baking sheet. Once oven warm, place in oven for 15 minutes</li>
                    <li>Scramble eggs and add cheese to scramble. Add a pinch of salt and pepper</li>
                    <li>When 15 minutes has elapsed, flip the hashbrowns and return to the oven for another 15 minutes</li>
                    <li>Start cooking turkey bacon</li>
                    <li>When there's about 7 minutes left on the oven, place small skillet on high with 1 tbsp of cooking oil</li>
                    <li>Test pan heat with a bit of egg. If it turns white immediately, it's the right temperature. Add scrambled egg and cheese mixture to the hot pan and immediately sift it around using a rubber spatula, ensuring all of the egg mixture cooks. Remove from heat and set aside</li>
                    <li>Once all things are cooked, assemble hashbrowns on a plate. Place folded turkey bacon strip on each hashbrown, top with the egg scramble and scallions for garnish. Serve with buttered toast and fresh tomato slices</li>
